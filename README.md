# pyopengl-snake
one level of classic snake game with snake-cam

this was written across two environments and seems to work the sasme on both. an I5 running windows and a 2core ubuntu linux dog, both using python 2.7 with pyopengl and numpy modules installed. pyopengl_accellerate made the windows machine not run it at all

keys are arrows and space to start.

snake grows longer all the time, food increases length, snake cam activated periodically, camera flip causes confusion. this is intentional.

if it is not fun, don't play.
